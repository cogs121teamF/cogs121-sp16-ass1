HEURISTICS
1. Visibility of system status
When users are being authenticated through their twitter account, they are taken to a page that tells them that they are being redirected. 

2. Match between system and the real world
Users’ posts are added to a list resembling an on-going conversation, which is a concept familiar to all users.

3. NEEDS MORE WORK User control and freedom
Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.

(For example, if user uploads a picture and a message, before sending, there should be a way to cancel and/or delete the picture to upload a different one, etc.)

4. Consistency and standards
All posts made by all users are consistent in format, that is, each post has a picture, a message and a shame button that users can use.

5. NEEDS MORE WORK Error prevention
Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.

Possible Ideas: 
- prevent users from posting without uploading a picture
- make a cancel button for the post, and just make it smaller/gray/less prominent than “Submit” button
- prevent user from clicking shame button more than once; gray out the shame button after user has clicked it once

6. Recognition rather than recall
The navigation bar, which includes the search bar and logout button, stay at the top of the page as the user scrolls down so that these two functions are always visible and easily accessed whenever appropriate. 

7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
Users who are accustomed to using the app may want to revisit the posts that they liked, in which case they can use the search bar to look for those posts, whereas a novice user may 

8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
Our user interface is as minimal as possible because it only requires the user to type a message, upload a photo, and/or shame someone’s parking by pushing the shame button. 

9. NEEDS MORE WORK Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

10. Help and documentation
In the footer area, there is information provided to contact us if the user needs help so that the user can easily find help by inquiring poopark@github.com their issue.
