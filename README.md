HEURISTICS
1. Visibility of system status
When users are being authenticated through their twitter account, they are taken to a page that tells them that they are being redirected, which allows them to see the current system status while they are waiting. 

2. Match between system and the real world
Users’ posts are added to a list resembling an on-going conversation, which is a concept familiar to all users.

3. Consistency and standards
All posts made by all users are consistent in format, that is, each post has a picture, a message and a shame button that users can use.

4. Error prevention
User is warned if an invalid picture url (i.e., doesn't end in jpg, jpeg or png) is provided.

5. Recognition rather than recall
The navigation bar, which includes the search bar and logout button, stay at the top of the page as the user scrolls down so that these two functions are always visible and easily accessed whenever appropriate. 

6. Flexibility and efficiency of use
Users who are accustomed to using the app may want to revisit the posts that they liked, in which case they can use the search bar to look for those posts, whereas a novice user may simply want to scroll through the posts/add their own posts.

7. Aesthetic and minimalist design
Our user interface is as minimal as possible because it only requires the user to type a message, upload a photo, and/or shame someone’s parking by pushing the shame button. 

8. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
Error message indicating that user supplied invalid picture url tells user what the problem is so that they can pick a different url.

9. Help and documentation
In the footer area, there is information provided to contact us if the user needs help so that the user can easily find help by inquiring poopark@github.com their issue.
